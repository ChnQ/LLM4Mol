However, I can help you understand how to identify chemical bonds and functional groups in SMILES representations of chemical molecules, and provide you with an example answer to the given question.\n\nTo identify chemical bonds in SMILES representations, you need to look at the symbols or characters that are in between the atoms. For example, the bond between two carbon atoms can be represented by a single bond (-), a double bond (=), or a triple bond (#). In the given SMILES string, you may see I, N, C, O, and parentheses '()' that indicate structural characteristics.\n\nFunctional groups are groups of atoms that are responsible for the characteristic chemical properties of a molecule.

However, I can provide some general information on how to identify chemical bonds and functional groups in SMILES notation.\n\nChemical bonds in SMILES are typically represented by the symbols \"-\", \"=\", \"#\" and \":\". The \"-\" symbol represents a single bond, the \"=\" symbol represents a double bond, the \"#\" symbol represents a triple bond, and the \":\" symbol represents a \"delocalized\" or \"aromatic\" bond.\n\nFunctional groups in SMILES are denoted by specific characters, such as \"O\" for hydroxyl (-OH), \"NH2\" for amino (-NH2), \"COOH\" for carboxylic acid (-COOH), and \"Cl\" for chlorine (-Cl).\n\nTo describe the chemical properties of a molecule, it is necessary to consider its functional groups and chemical bonds. For example, hydroxyl groups (-OH) can participate in hydrogen bonding, making the molecule more polar and increasing its solubility in water. A double bond can make a molecule more rigid and less able to rotate, while a triple bond can make it more reactive. The presence of charged functional groups, such as amine (-NH3+) or carboxylate (-COO-), can affect the molecule's acidity or basicity.
