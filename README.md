## Can Large Language Models Empower Molecular Properties Prediction?



## Requirements

The following pakages are required to run the code:

- python==3.8.0

- pytorch==1.12.1

- cudatoolkit==11.3

- networkx==2.5

- rdkit==2023.3.1

- deepchem== 2.7.1

  

## Training and evaluation

You can directly run the program after modifying the basic hyperparameters in the script `example.sh` :

```bash
sh example.sh
```
